# Contributing to jstack codebases

Normally, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file contains information on how to contribute to a single repository or project,
but this one helps you in becoming a good jstackian developer.

## Repository naming

When naming your repositories, try to stick to the `context--project--part` pattern.  
We'll illustrate this with some examples:  
  
Let's say you're responsible for the backend/server/API for the 'Cemently' solution for our new client, John Cement Ltd.  
You would create the `john-cement--cemently--api` repository to house your codebase.  
If you are starting development on the web app part of that project, you would create `john-cement--cemently--web`.
  
Imagine jstack is going to develop their own invoicing application that will consist of a backend, an app, and some scripts.  
You would end up with `jstack--invoiceroo--api`, `jstack--invoiceroo--app`, and `jstack--invoiceroo--scripts`.
  
If you are an intern, you can start your repository names with `internship--`.  
Examples woul be `internship--musicians--api` and `internship--incrudible--server`.
